# EcoHub

EcoHub is a platform that empowers users to contribute to a cleaner environment by reporting waste issues in natural and urban areas. The platform connects concerned citizens, government officials, NGOs, and startups to manage and address waste effectively. EcoHub facilitates the collection, tracking, and recycling of waste through a transparent and collaborative approach.

## Problem Statement

Waste management is a significant challenge that affects communities, wildlife, and the environment. Many areas suffer from illegal dumping, uncollected waste, and lack of awareness regarding proper waste disposal and recycling practices. Current solutions often lack transparency and citizen involvement, which hampers effective waste management.

EcoHub aims to solve these problems by:

- Enabling citizens to report waste issues in forests, urban areas, or other locations.
- Connecting reports with relevant government officials, NGOs, and waste management startups.
- Creating a streamlined process for waste collection and recycling.
- Facilitating the sale and responsible handling of household waste materials.
